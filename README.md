Haskell mahjong library

------

## Versioning

This project uses semvar for it's versioning and currently we are still in the
experimental 0.1 phase.

If you would like to contribute to the development please see the contributing
section below.

## Contributing

I try to be pretty lax about things so if you have a suggestion that I could be
doing go right ahead and open a ticket, fork and implement something, or just
leave me a feature request on github issues.

Eventually I would like to get this project to support the many variants, game
modes, and include some libraries for bot players that people can use.

## License

This library uses MIT, so feel free to use it for whatever you would like. If
you do end up using it I'd love to hear about what it is being used for.
